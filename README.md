### Troubleshooting
In case of issues with external APIs, the application provides fallback mechanisms:

#### Login Server Downtime:

Update the EXPO_PUBLIC_LOGIN_URL in the .env file to point to http://localhost:3000.

Navigate to the /server directory.

Run the following command to start the local login validation server:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
#### Cars API Server Downtime:

Update the EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL in the .env file to point to http://localhost:3000.

Navigate to the /server directory.

Run the following command to start the local cars API server:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
